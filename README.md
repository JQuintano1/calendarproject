I want to design a calendar system that would be sufficient enough and simple enough to have my whole family use. It will be able to display
the time constantly and also be able to take in input of a date and give back what day of the week that date is.
It will also be able to take events and other things that need to be planned as inputs and place them on the calendar to constantly be display,
and send a reminder later when the event is coming up.

As I get deeper into college and busier every semester, I find its very difficult to keep in mind all the things I and my family are up to on
a day to day basis, so having something that can constantly be displayed is something I'm really passionate about making.

I believe this project will take a lot of effort, particularly in understanding and utilizing JavaFX since we've learned it so recently, but
I believe we still have more than enough time for me to figure things out.
